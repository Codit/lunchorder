# lunchorder
Lunch order is a web application where a user can order lunch using money that was paid in advance. The order will then be delivered by a lunch company at lunchtime.
In essence, it should solve the following problems:
- Users that forget to pay for lunch
- Users that log the wrong payment amount
- User can order from a remote location
- The order will be sent to the lunch company on time
- Correct total payment amount will be known up front and ready on delivery.

The application is being been developed primarily to get a better understanding on how [angular2] works.
